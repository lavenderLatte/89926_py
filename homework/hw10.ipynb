    "\n",
    "1. You can add a new cell by clicking on the \"+\" icon on top.\n",
    "2. You can delete a cell by selecting that cell and clicking on the \"scissors\" icon on top.\n",
    "3. You can execute a cell by either pressing shift+enter or selecting the \"play\" button on top.\n",
    "4. You can create a new file in Jupyter via the File menu->New Notebook option. Make sure to select Python 2 when creating your notebook.\n",
    "5. Also, for your code blocks make sure that Code is selected instead of another option like Markdown.\n",
    "6. Use the Enter key to go to the next line in a cell to enter the next statement.\n",
    "7. You can clear results by clicking on the Cell menu item and selecting Current Output->Clear or All Output->Clear depending on whether you are trying to just clear the output for one cell or for all cells.\n",
    "8. In case your program has crashed for some reason (infinite loop, for example), you can restart your Python session by select Kernel in the menu and selecting Restart.\n"

    "_Answer_\n",
    "\n",
    "1-1. One reason is for code reusability. By defining a class, we can reuse the class inside of other class without rewriting the same code again(composition). Or, when multiple classes shared the similar properties and behaviors, we can define a base class(superclass) and create subclasses that has only subclass specific things(inheritance). <br>\n",
    "    The other reason is OOP increases the modularity and decrease the complexity of code. Especially, when we work with many people as a team to build something, we can code each piece of things in parallel. Since each class should be \"stand-alone\", even if soemebody else's code changed, it doesn't affect my part of class and makes code maintenance easy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1-2. It's about hiding data or methods. If these properties are public, they are accessible(i.e. get value, set value) from outside of the class - weak encapsulation. Whereas, the properties are private, they are only accessible from within the class. When data properties are private, we usually define Setter and Getter functions to access to them."
